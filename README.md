# Computer Science Concepts

Steve Yegge has an [interesting blogpost](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.in/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html) in which his says :
I think the best way to start learning math is to spend 15 to 30 minutes a day surfing in Wikipedia. It's filled with articles about thousands of little branches of mathematics. You start with pretty much any article that seems interesting (e.g. String theory, say, or the Fourier transform, or Tensors, anything that strikes your fancy.) Start reading. If there's something you don't understand, click the link and read about it. Do this recursively until you get bored or tired.
Doing this will give you amazing perspective on mathematics, after a few months. You'll start seeing patterns, ... and you'll download a PDF or buy a book, and you'll figure out enough to make you happy for a while.

So with this project i'm trying to apply that but mostly for computer science concepts that i don't know and math concepts related to it.
